# Gulp Boilerplate

Personal boilerplate setup for projects, using [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/), [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), and my preferences for pre-processors and directory structure.

## Getting Started

This project includes the following Gulp plugins:

- [Sass](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-sass)
- [Compass](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-compass)
- [Concat](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-concat)
- [Jade](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-jade)
- [JsHint](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-jshint)
- [Uglify](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-uglify)
- [Connect (with LiveReload)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-connect)

After pulling down the repository, run the following to get started:

    npm install
    gulp

By default, the server will load at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
