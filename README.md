# Gulp Boilerplate

Personal boilerplate setup for projects, using [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/), [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), and my preferences for pre-processors and directory structure.

## Getting Started

This project includes the following Gulp plugins:

- [Sass](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-sass)
- [Concat](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-concat)
- [Jade](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-jade)
- [JsHint](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-jshint)
- [Uglify](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-uglify)
- [Connect (with LiveReload)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-connect)

After pulling down the repository, cd into the working directory and run the following to get started:

    npm install
    npm install -g gulp
    gulp

By default, the LiveReload server will load up on port 8080 (adjustable in gulpfile), accessible via localhost or your machine's IP address through a mobile browser on the same network.
